# Air Ticket Sales System (Backend)

This repository contains the full source code for the backend of my group's solution to the 2nd year group project at City, University of London.

We have been asked to build from the bottom a fully functional system that will keep records of tickets sold by a travel agency to customers, and produce reports required by an airline. All parts of the system are based on exact specification and requirements provided to the students by the University.

### Our solution

We have chosen to create the system as a web app, based purely on React for the user interface, and Node & Express server-side, with MongoDB as our chosen database. There is a separate repository for the front end to this project, and is available [here](https://github.com/PiotrRut/AirTicketSales-System).

### Intallation

In order to run the back end on your local machine, clone this repository, and run `node app.js` or `nodemon app.js` inside it (nodemon allows to update the source code and see the changes immediately, without having to restart the server). This will run the app at http://localhost:5000.
