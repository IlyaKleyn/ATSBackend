# :airplane: Air Ticket Sales System (Back end)

This repository contains the full source code for the backend of my group's solution to the 2nd year group project at City, University of London.

We have been asked to build from the bottom a fully functional system that will keep records of tickets sold by a travel agency to customers, and produce reports required by an airline. All parts of the system are based on exact specification and requirements provided to the students by the University.

### Our solution

We have chosen to create the system as a web app, based purely on React for the user interface, and Node & Express server-side, with MongoDB as our database. There is a separate repository for the front end to this project, and is available [here](https://github.com/PiotrRut/ATSFrontend).

__The API documentation is available [here](https://api6.prutkowski.tech)__

This backend is utilising:
* PassportJS and JWT for user authentication and authorisation
* BCrypt for hashing and encrypting the passwords
* MongoDB database system for storing and retrieving information
