# :airplane: Air Ticket Sales System (Back end)

This repository contains the full source code of the solution to the 2nd year group project at City, University of London.

We have been asked to build from the bottom a fully functional system that will keep records of tickets sold by a travel agency to customers, and produce reports required by an airline. All parts of the system are based on exact specification and requirements provided to the students by the University.

### Our solution

Our solution was based around creating the system as a web app, based purely on React for the user interface, and Node & Express server-side, with MongoDB as the database. The GUI is made using the [material-ui](https://material-ui.com) library, based on Google's Material UI guidelines. There is a separate repository for the front end to this project, and is available [here](https://github.com/PiotrRut/ATSFrontend).

__The API documentation is available [here](https://api6.prutkowski.tech)__

This project is utilising:
* PassportJS and JWT for user authentication and authorisation
* BCrypt for safe password encryption
* MongoDB database system for storing and retrieving information
